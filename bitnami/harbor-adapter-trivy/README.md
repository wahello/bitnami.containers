# Harbor Adapter Trivy packaged by Bitnami

## What is Harbor Adapter Trivy?

> Harbor Adapter for Trivy translates the Harbor API into Trivy API calls and allows Harbor to provide vulnerability reports on images through Trivy as part of its vulnerability scan.

## TL;DR

This container is part of the [Harbor solution](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/harbor) that is primarily intended to be deployed in Kubernetes. You can deploy Harbor solution and then enable this specific container with the command below:

```console
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-harbor-portal/master/docker-compose.yml
$ curl -L https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-harbor-portal/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xz --strip=1 --wildcards '*-master/config'
$ docker-compose up
```

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`2`, `2-debian-11`, `2.5.3`, `2.5.3-debian-11-r0`, `latest` (2/debian-11/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-harbor-adapter-trivy/blob/2.5.3-debian-11-r0/2/debian-11/Dockerfile)

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Harbor-Adapter-Trivy Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-harbor-adapter-trivy.git#master:2/debian-11'
```

## Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a directory at the `/bitnami` path. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run.

```console
$ docker run \
    -v /path/to/harbor-adapter-trivy-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:latest
```

You can also do this with a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-harbor-adapter-trivy/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
harbor-adapter-trivy:
  ...
  volumes:
    - /path/to/harbor-adapter-trivy-persistence:/bitnami
  ...
```

## Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

### Using the Command Line

#### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create harbor-adapter-trivy-network --driver bridge
```

#### Step 2: Launch the Harbor-Adapter-Trivy container within your network

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `harbor-adapter-trivy-network` network.

```console
$ docker run --name harbor-adapter-trivy-node1 --network harbor-adapter-trivy-network bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:latest
```

#### Step 3: Run another containers

We can launch another containers using the same flag (`--network NETWORK`) in the `docker run` command. If you also set a name to your container, you will be able to use it as hostname in your network.

## Configuration

Harbor Adapter Trivy is a component of the Harbor application. In order to get the Harbor application running on Kubernetes we encourage you to check the [bitnami/harbor Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/harbor) and configure it using the options exposed in the values.yaml file.

For further information about the specific component itself, please refer to the [source repository documentation](https://github.com/aquasecurity/harbor-scanner-trivy#configuration).

## Logging

The Bitnami Harbor-Adapter-Trivy Docker image sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs harbor-adapter-trivy
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Maintenance

### Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Harbor-Adapter-Trivy, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

#### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:latest
```

#### Step 2: Stop the running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```console
$ docker stop harbor-adapter-trivy
```

#### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```console
$ docker rm -v harbor-adapter-trivy
```

#### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```console
$ docker run --name harbor-adapter-trivy bitnami/harbor-adapter-trivy:latest
```
