## TL;DR

### Docker Compose

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

**Warning**: This quick setup is only intended for development environments. You are encouraged to change the insecure default credentials and check out the available configuration options in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for a more secure deployment.

### Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## How to deploy Joomla! in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami Joomla! Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/joomla).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

### Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

### Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

### Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Joomla! Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/joomla).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/joomla:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/joomla/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/joomla:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/joomla:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla.git#master:4/debian-11'
```

### How to use this image

Joomla! requires access to a MySQL or MariaDB database to store information. We'll use the [Bitnami Docker Image for MariaDB](https://www.github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb) for the database requirements.

#### Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of this repository contains a functional [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file. Run the application using it as shown below:

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Using the Docker Command Line

If you want to run the application manually instead of using `docker-compose`, these are the basic steps you need to run:

##### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create joomla-network
```

##### Step 2: Create a volume for MariaDB persistence and create a MariaDB container

```console
$ docker volume create --name mariadb_data
$ docker run -d --name mariadb \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env MARIADB_USER=bn_joomla \
  --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_joomla \
  --network joomla-network \
  --volume mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb \
  bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

##### Step 3: Create volumes for Joomla! persistence and launch the container

```console
$ docker volume create --name joomla_data
$ docker run -d --name joomla \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_USER=bn_joomla \
  --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_joomla \
  --network joomla-network \
  --volume joomla_data:/bitnami/joomla \
  bitnami/joomla:latest
```

Access your application at `http://your-ip/`

### Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a directory at the `/bitnami/joomla` path. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run. Additionally you should mount a volume for persistence of the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#persisting-your-database).

The above examples define the Docker volumes named mariadb_data and joomla_data. The Joomla! application state will persist as long as volumes are not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of volumes, you can mount host directories as data volumes. Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

#### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

This requires a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```diff
   mariadb:
     ...
     volumes:
-      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
+      - /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb
   ...
   joomla:
     ...
     volumes:
-      - 'joomla_data:/bitnami/joomla'
+      - /path/to/joomla-persistence:/bitnami/joomla
   ...
-volumes:
-  mariadb_data:
-    driver: local
-  joomla_data:
-    driver: local
```

> NOTE: As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`.

#### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

##### Step 1: Create a network (if it does not exist)

```console
$ docker network create joomla-network
```

##### Step 2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume

```console
$ docker run -d --name mariadb \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env MARIADB_USER=bn_joomla \
  --env MARIADB_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_joomla \
  --network joomla-network \
  --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
  bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

##### Step 3. Create the Joomla! container with host volumes

```console
$ docker run -d --name joomla \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 \
  --env ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_USER=bn_joomla \
  --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_PASSWORD=bitnami \
  --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_joomla \
  --network joomla-network \
  --volume /path/to/joomla-persistence:/bitnami/joomla \
  bitnami/joomla:latest
```

### Configuration

### Environment variables

When you start the Joomla! image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the `docker run` command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

 * For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
joomla:
  ...
  environment:
    - JOOMLA_PASSWORD=my_password
  ...
```

 * For manual execution add a `--env` option with each variable and value:

  ```console
  $ docker run -d --name joomla -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --env JOOMLA_PASSWORD=my_password \

###### Example

This would be an example of SMTP configuration using a Gmail account:

 * Modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
  joomla:
    ...
    environment:
      - JOOMLA_DATABASE_USER=bn_joomla
      - JOOMLA_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_joomla
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - JOOMLA_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
      - JOOMLA_SMTP_PORT=587
      - JOOMLA_SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
      - JOOMLA_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
      - JOOMLA_SMTP_PROTOCOL=tls
  ...
```
 * For manual execution:

  ```console
  $ docker run -d --name joomla -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_USER=bn_joomla \
    --env JOOMLA_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_joomla \
    --env JOOMLA_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com \
    --env JOOMLA_SMTP_PORT=587 \
    --env JOOMLA_SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com \
    --env JOOMLA_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password \
    --env JOOMLA_SMTP_PROTOCOL=tls \
    --network joomla-tier \
    --volume /path/to/joomla-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/joomla:latest
  ```

#### Installing additional language packs

By default, this container packs a generic English version of Joomla!. Nevertheless, more Language Packs can be added to the default configuration using the in-platform Administration [interface](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Setup_a_Multilingual_Site/Installing_New_Language). In order to fully support a new Language Pack it is also a requirement to update the system's locales files. We highly recommend [extending](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla#extend-this-image) the default image and adding as many locales as needed:
+Stop the currently running container using the command

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/joomla
RUN echo "es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen && locale-gen
```

Bear in mind that in the example above `es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8` is the locale needed for the desired Language Pack to install. You may change this value to the locale corresponding to your pack.

### Logging

The Bitnami Joomla! Docker image sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs joomla
```

Or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose logs joomla
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

### Maintenance

#### Backing up your container

To backup your data, configuration and logs, follow these simple steps:

##### Step 1: Stop the currently running container

```console
$ docker stop joomla
```

Or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose stop joomla
```

##### Step 2: Run the backup command

We need to mount two volumes in a container we will use to create the backup: a directory on your host to store the backup in, and the volumes from the container we just stopped so we can access the data.

```console
$ docker run --rm -v /path/to/joomla-backups:/backups --volumes-from joomla busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/joomla /backups/latest
```

#### Restoring a backup

Restoring a backup is as simple as mounting the backup as volumes in the containers.

For the MariaDB database container:

```diff
 $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
   ...
-  --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
+  --volume /path/to/mariadb-backups/latest:/bitnami/mariadb \
   bitnami/mariadb:latest
```

For the Joomla! container:

```diff
 $ docker run -d --name joomla \
   ...
-  --volume /path/to/joomla-persistence:/bitnami/joomla \
+  --volume /path/to/joomla-backups/latest:/bitnami/joomla \
   bitnami/joomla:latest
```

#### Upgrade this image

> **NOTE:** Application upgrades should be done manually inside the docker container following the [official documentation](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Updating_from_an_existing_version).
> As an alternative, you can try upgrading using an updated Docker image. However, any data from the Joomla! container will be lost and you will have to reinstall all the plugins and themes you manually added.

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and Joomla!, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Joomla! container. For the MariaDB upgrade see: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

##### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/joomla:latest
```

##### Step 2: Stop the running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```console
$ docker-compose stop joomla
```

##### Step 3: Take a snapshot of the application state

Follow the steps in [Backing up your container](#backing-up-your-container) to take a snapshot of the current application state.

##### Step 4: Remove the currently running container

Remove the currently running container by executing the following command:

```console
docker-compose rm -v joomla
```

##### Step 5: Run the new image

Update the image tag in `docker-compose.yml` and re-create your container with the new image:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Customize this image

The Bitnami Joomla! Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

#### Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

- Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the ports used by Apache for HTTP and HTTPS, by setting the environment variables `APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER` and `APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER` respectively.
- [Adding custom virtual hosts](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#adding-custom-virtual-hosts).
- [Replacing the 'httpd.conf' file](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#full-configuration).
- [Using custom SSL certificates](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/joomla
### Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

- Install the `vim` editor
- Modify the Apache configuration file
- Modify the ports used by Apache

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/joomla

### Change user to perform privileged actions
USER 0
### Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim
### Revert to the original non-root user
USER 1001

### Enable mod_ratelimit module
RUN sed -i -r 's/#LoadModule ratelimit_module/LoadModule ratelimit_module/' /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf

### Modify the ports used by Apache by default
## It is also possible to change these environment variables at runtime
ENV APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181
ENV APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER=8143
EXPOSE 8181 8143
```

Based on the extended image, you can update the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository to add other features:

```diff
   joomla:
-    image: bitnami/joomla:latest
+    build: .
     ports:
-      - '80:8080'
-      - '443:8443'
+      - '80:8181'
+      - '443:8143'
     environment:
       ...
+      - PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=512m
     ...
```

## Notable Changes

### 3.9.20-debian-10-r0

- The size of the container image has been decreased.
- The configuration logic is now based on Bash scripts in the *rootfs/* folder.
- The Joomla! container image has been migrated to a "non-root" user approach. Previously the container ran as the `root` user and the Apache daemon was started as the `daemon` user. From now on, both the container and the Apache daemon run as user `1001`. You can revert this behavior by changing `USER 1001` to `USER root` in the Dockerfile, or `user: root` in `docker-compose.yml`. Consequences:
  - The HTTP/HTTPS ports exposed by the container are now `8080/8443` instead of `80/443`.
  - Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed when data is persisted using docker or docker-compose. We highly recommend migrating the Joomla! site by exporting its content, and importing it on a new Joomla! container. Follow the steps in [Backing up your container](#backing-up-your-container) and [Restoring a backup](#restoring-a-backup) to migrate the data between the old and new container.

### 3.9.6-debian-9-r12 and 3.9.6-ol-7-r14

- This image has been adapted so it's easier to customize. See the [Customize this image](#customize-this-image) section for more information.
- The Apache configuration volume (`/bitnami/apache`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the Apache configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom Apache configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
- The PHP configuration volume (`/bitnami/php`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the PHP configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom PHP configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/php/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
- Enabling custom Apache certificates by placing them at `/opt/bitnami/apache/certs` has been deprecated, and support for this functionality will be dropped in the near future. Users wanting to enable custom certificates are advised to mount their certificate files on top of the preconfigured ones at `/certs`.
