## TL;DR

This image is meant to run in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`1`, `1-debian-11`, `1.5.0`, `1.5.0-debian-11-r17`, `latest` (1/debian-11/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-jupyterhub/blob/1.5.0-debian-11-r17/1/debian-11/Dockerfile)

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami jupyterhub Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jupyterhub).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/jupyterhub:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jupyterhub/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/jupyterhub:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/jupyterhub:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-jupyterhub.git#master:1/debian-11'
```

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

## Configuration
