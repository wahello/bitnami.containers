## Why use Intel optimized containers

Optimized containers fully leverage 3rd gen Intel(R) Xeon(R) Scalable Processor (Ice Lake) cores and architecture. Intel(R) AVX-512 instructions have been further improved to accelerate performance for HPC/AI across a diverse set of workloads, including 3D modeling, scientific simulation, financial analytics, machine learning, and AI, image processing, visualization, digital content creation, and data compression. This wider vectorization speeds computation processes per clock, increasing frequency over the prior generation. New instructions, coupled with algorithmic and software innovations, also deliver breakthrough performance for the industry's most widely deployed cryptographic ciphers. Security is becoming more pervasive with most organizations increasingly adopting encryption for application execution, data in flight, and data storage.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Envoy for Intel Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/envoy-intel).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/envoy-intel:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/envoy-intel/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/envoy-intel:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/envoy-intel:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-envoy-intel.git#master:1.20/debian-11'
```

## Configuration

### Running commands

To run commands inside this container you can use `docker run`, for example to execute `envoy --version` you can follow the example below:

```console
$ docker run --rm --name envoy bitnami/envoy-intel:latest -- --version
```

Check the [official envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/cli) for a list of the available parameters.

### Adding your custom configuration

By default, envoy will look for a configuration file in `/opt/bitnami/envoy/conf/envoy.yaml`. You can launch the envoy container with your custom configuration with the command below:

```console
$ docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/envoy.yaml:/opt/bitnami/envoy/conf/envoy.yaml bitnami/envoy-intel:latest
```

Visit the [official envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/configuration) for all the available configurations.
